# Overview
Ebol is a modelling language aimed at separating business and application logic from underlying platform. It's an approach to implement the idea of Model Driven Architecture.

Traditionally, the product manager relied on keynotes/ppt/uml or anything alike to explain the concept model in his mind to developers. In 
most cases, the idea is not expressed in a logical way, it's usually left to the developers who finally made things clear reasoning. As a 
result, even developers got a better understanding of the business logic than the manager. In our view, the logic of a concept model should 
be developed and maintained by the product manager, while developers focus on platform specific issues. But it's not practical to achieve
such a goal without a proper tool to convey the logic from product manager's mind to developers'. UML seems a silver bullet at first glance,
yet it has drawbacks. For example, UML has coarse-grained control over the logic expression,  so it fails to drive the underlying system. 
The problems with general purpose programming languages come from their high flexibility, which makes it hard to extract the key logic
expression. The grammar should be restricted.  All these considerations lead to Ebol.
